<h2>Method 2:</h2>

<p><code>x11vnc</code> is a simple VNC server and you won't have to mess around with Gnome settings or 500 firewalls, just install <code>x11vnc</code> on all your computers (with puppet or whatever you're using for mass-control).</p>

<p>Then from your local computer run:</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@host -L 5900:localhost:5900 "x11vnc -display :0 -noxdamage"
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously swapping <code>user@host</code> for the username and hostname/IP of the remote computer.</p>

<p>And then use a VNC client of your choice to connect to <code>localhost:5900</code>. The SSH command starts a vnc server on the remote computer and then tunnels back that port over SSH. You don't have to open up any ports (as long as you can already SSH).</p>

<p>If your computers have funny display settings, you might do better to leave off the <code>-display :0</code> segment in the SSH command. <code>x11vnc</code> will then automatically try to find the right display.</p>
